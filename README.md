# URL Fuzzer Pentesting

Easy to use and understand. Written in Python. 
Only use on targets you have permission to test. 

# Usage 

Clone repository and run 
'''bash 
url_fuzzer.py
'''
Then input a target site, and a wait time in seconds between pings. A wait time will allow the server time to respond to the requests and not overload it or ban your IP. 200 responses will be written to a new .txt file. dirb.txt is provided and has a list of about 4000 potential directories to looks for. 

### WARNING
Once again, only use on targets you have permission to test. This is for learning purposes, understanding on web responses, hidden directories in sites, and hopefully can help secure a few websites.
